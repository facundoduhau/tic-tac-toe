# ⭕ Tic Tac Toe ❌
This is the eighth "The Odin Project" exercise.

Coded with HTML, Css and JavaScript.

Project was made to work on arrays, changing the inner html of boxes in a Css Grid, and using logic to understand:
* If the game is running.
* Who's turn it is.
* Check if, when a box is selected, there is a winner.
* Pop a message when there is a draw or a winner.

The game is single player, meaning, you're playing against "The Machine"

Option to ask the user if he wants to play single player or with two players could be added.

Fun game to practice some Js Logic

This project helped me better understand array logic, and make functions much "friendlier" in a sense.

It's a nice coding exercise to work on JavaScript and improve on it.
